\title{
    Remove low density regions of a flowFrame.
}

\description{
    Remove low density regions of a flowFrame.
}

\usage{
    removeLowDensSections (f, Time.loc, Segment=500, LowDensityRemoval=0.1, Verbose=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
    \item{f}{
        A single flowFrame to be processed.
    }
    \item{Time.loc}{
        An positive interger value for the location of the time channel.
    }
    \item{Segment}{
        An integer value that specifies the number of events in each segment to be analyzed. A single segment is defaulted to contain 500 events.
    }
    \item{LowDensityRemoval}{
        An numeric value between 0 and 1 that specifies the proportion cut-off of the low density region. All events with less density than LowDensityRemoval will be removed. The default is 0.1.
    }
    \item{Verbose}{
        A logical value that dictates if computational information is printed while the code is running. The default is FALSE.
    }
}

\details{
    removeLowDensSections removes low density regions of a flowFlame. The flowFrame must have a time channel.
}

\value{
    A list containing two elements. The first element, $frame, is the flowFrame file returned after removeLowDensSections has removed the low density sections. The second element, $rem.ind, is a vector containing indices of events being removed.
